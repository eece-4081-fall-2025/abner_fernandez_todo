User Stories for the ToDo App (The "five" Project)

This document outlines 18+ required user stories, organized into Epics, for the development of the ToDo application.

Epic 1: Task Management (Core Functionality)

This Epic covers all fundamental operations related to creating, viewing, and modifying tasks.

As a User, I want to quickly add a new task using a simple input field, so that I can capture an idea or reminder immediately without navigating complex menus.

As a User, I want to view a list of all my pending tasks, so that I can see everything I need to accomplish in one place.

As a User, I want to mark a task as complete, so that I can track my progress and remove completed items from the active list.

As a User, I want to edit the title or description of an existing task, so that I can correct mistakes or update details as my requirements change.

As a User, I want to delete a task entirely, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant or were added by mistake.

As a User, I want to see a running count of incomplete tasks, so that I have a quick metric of my workload displayed on the dashboard.

As a User, I want to view an archive of my completed tasks, so that I can review past accomplishments or retrieve information from finished items.

Epic 2: Organization and Prioritization

This Epic focuses on tools that help the user organize their tasks for better focus and efficiency.

As a User, I want to assign a priority level (High, Medium, Low) to a task, so that I can quickly identify and focus on the most critical items.

As a User, I want to sort my task list by priority, so that the most urgent tasks appear at the top of the list.

As a User, I want to sort my task list by due date, so that I can address tasks chronologically before they expire.

As a User, I want to assign categories or tags (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Groceries") to a task, so that I can group related items together.

As a User, I want to filter the task list by category or tag, so that I can focus only on tasks related to a specific area of my life (e.g., only "Work" items).

Epic 3: Scheduling and Reminders

This Epic ensures the app supports time-based management and alerts.

As a User, I want to assign a specific due date to a task, so that I know when the task needs to be completed.

As a User, I want to receive a notification/reminder before a task's due date, so that I don't miss important deadlines.

As a User, I want to see tasks that are overdue highlighted in red, so that I can immediately notice and address my missed deadlines.

Epic 4: User Experience and Accessibility

This Epic addresses visual and quality-of-life features.

As a User, I want to search for tasks based on keywords in the title or description, so that I can quickly locate a specific task, even in a long list.

As a User, I want to undo the last action (e.g., accidental deletion or completion), so that I can quickly recover from minor mistakes without data loss.

As a User, I want the app to be fully responsive on mobile and desktop devices, so that I can manage my tasks whether I am at my desk or on the go.

As a User, I want to be able to switch to a Dark Mode theme, so that I can reduce eye strain while using the app in low-light environments.

As a User, I want to drag and drop tasks to reorder them manually, so that I can create a custom order of importance that overrides standard sorting.
